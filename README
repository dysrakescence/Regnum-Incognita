# Regnum Incognita
> unexplored territory/kingdom

A 2.5D game that is currently in development.

## Plot

An innocent civilian from another planet was accused of murder. Their lawyer convinced the judge to not give the death sentence, but 40 years in prison instead. In a twist of fate, the mastermind who committed the crime somehow accidentally swapped their escape spaceship with the prison spaceship, causing the innocent victim to fly off into space instead.

**You** were the innocent civilian who was wrongly accused of this hidious crime, but now that the mastermind has erroneously sent you off into space, you discovered that eventually the spaceship will land somewhere in a habitable planet. What will you find there, and would you be able to survive?
